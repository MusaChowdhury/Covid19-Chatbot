# Covid19 Based Chat-Bot (Chatty)
A javaFX-based dummy chatbot, which incorporates web-scraping to fetch information and some hardcoded replies (about covid).
</br>
This project was my first JavaFX application. The only goal of the project was to create a messaging app like interface and provide some functionality.

# Note
The **IntelliJ IDE** was used and the platform was **Ubuntu 22.04.1** while **updating the project**.
</br>
JDK Version : openjdk 18.0.2-ea

# Features
As said before, it is a dummy project. This doesn't have any useful functionality.
</br>
But the application implements **web-scraping** and **web-browser (provided by JavaFX)**.
